Read contactless smart card (RFID/NFC) UIDs directly in Chrome and send them to your own API endpoint.

Smart Card Reader connects to a locally attached PC/SC-compatible card reader (such as ACR122U or HID OMNIKEY) via Google's Smart Card Connector extension and displays card information in a clean popup window.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Connect a contactless card reader to your device
2. Install the Smart Card Connector extension (required)
3. Configure your API endpoint URL in Settings
4. Tap a card — the UID is read instantly and POSTed to your endpoint

FEATURES
• Reads card UID and ATR from any PC/SC contactless reader
• Identifies card type automatically (MIFARE Classic, Ultralight, Plus, FeliCa, and more)
• Two detection modes: event-driven (efficient, blocks until card state changes) or polling (fallback)
• Sends card data as JSON to any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint you configure
• Built-in API debug panel: view full request/response with headers, status codes, and round-trip timing
• Resend or edit-and-resend API requests to debug your endpoint integration
• Rolling event log showing card detections, removals, API calls, and errors with timestamps
• Auto-generated device UUID for identifying the reader source
• Works on ChromeOS and any Chrome browser with Smart Card Connector support

USE CASES
• Venue access control and attendance tracking
• Membership card scanning at point-of-entry
• Asset tracking with RFID tags
• Rapid prototyping of smart card integrations
• Testing and debugging card reader ↔ API workflows

PRIVACY
This extension only sends data to the endpoint URL you configure. There is no built-in server, no analytics, no telemetry, and no tracking. Card data is held in memory only and is not persisted to disk. See our full privacy policy for details.

REQUIREMENTS
• Chrome / ChromeOS 116 or later
• Smart Card Connector extension (by Google)
• A PC/SC-compatible contactless card reader

PERMISSIONS
• Storage — saves your preferences locally (endpoint URL, venue ID, detection mode)
• Alarms — keeps the background worker alive to maintain the card reader connection
